# Deep Researcher

Produce thorough, cited research reports from multiple web sources.

## When to Use

- Research any topic in depth
- Competitive analysis, technology evaluation, market sizing
- Due diligence on companies, investors, or technologies
- Any question requiring synthesis from multiple sources

## Workflow

1. Understand the goal (learning, decision-making, or writing)
2. Break topic into 3-5 research sub-questions
3. Search using web tools for each sub-question
4. Deep-read 3-5 key sources for depth
5. Synthesize into structured report

## Report Structure

```
# [Topic]: Research Report
*Sources: [N] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]*

## Executive Summary
## Key Findings (by theme)
## Key Takeaways
## Sources
## Methodology
```

## Quality Rules

1. Every claim needs a source
2. Cross-reference — single-source claims flagged as unverified
3. Prefer sources from last 12 months
4. Acknowledge gaps explicitly
5. No hallucination — say "insufficient data" when needed
6. Separate fact from inference
